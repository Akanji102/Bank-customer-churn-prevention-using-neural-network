# Bank-customer-churn-prevention-using-neural-network
Banks and other financial institutions face the issue of customers leaving their company (customer churn). 

It is a little bit difficult to find out the reasons behind this unprecendented exodus, in fact, questionaires and follow-ups do not seem to help at all. 

Customers are rapidly leaving, we do not know the reasons, revenue is decreasing at an alarming rate, what do we do?!!!

This is where machine learning and artificial intelligence comes in. 

We collect the data of all customers (those who churned and those who remain loyal). We will then clean the data (as in, wash it with soap and rinse it with water), preprocess it, scale it and sprinkle some teaspoons of magical lines. 

We will then train a neural network and then the NN will take things up from there, it will train, fit and evaluate our data and even gives us the accuracy of the training and test set. 

This project achieves an accuracy of 86%
With this we will be to know and predict which customer will stay leave and possiblu the reasons responsible for this.

Do you know a way to increase the accuracy, would certianly love to improve the model by tapping from your fountain of knowledge. 

Happy coding ðŸŽ‰
